# SiSAD: Semi-supervised Stamps Anomaly Detection for ZTF and LSST

## Overview

SiSAD (Semi-supervised Stamps Anomaly Detection) will be a machine learning framework designed to identify anomalies in astronomical stamps (new image, reference image and difference image), specifically targeting the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). By using semi-supervised ML learning techniques, SiSAD aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.

## Features

- **Semi-supervised Learning Approach**: Uses unlabeled images to discriminate between different type of image anomalies.
- **Specialized for Astronomical Data**: Tailored for processing and analyzing stamps from ZTF and LSST, but generalizable to any astronomical observatory.
- **High Scalability**: Designed to handle the vast amounts of data generated by modern astronomical surveys.
- **Interactive Visualization**: (Hopefully) Will offer tools for the visual inspection of detected anomalies and clusters.
- **Open-Source and Community-Driven**: Encourages contributions and feedback from the astronomical and machine learning communities.
